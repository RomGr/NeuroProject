At the beginning of the course, I created an account on c4sience (I follow the instructions of wiki epfl). 
So, my first commits were on this website. 
Then, I moved to GitHub (the link is https://github.com/RomGr) but I do not have all the 
commits on GitHub as they are on c4sience (https://c4science.ch/source/NeuroProject/).

Thank you for your understanding.
